**Project description**:
A site to demonstrate understanding of CSS Positioning and building out a basic website with some interactive elements.

**Problem domain:**
CSS Positioning

**User stories:**
🐿️ As a user, I want the web page to have a clear structure with a recognisable header, footer, and navigation sections, so that I can easily navigate and understand the content.
🐿️ As a user, I want the layout and navigation links to be responsive and well-organised, so that I can easily access and interact with the website.
🐿️ As a user, I want to see text overlaid on images or other elements in a visually appealing way, so that the content is engaging and enhances my browsing experience.
🐿️ As a user, I want images to load correctly and be displayed properly on the web page, so that my viewing experience is seamless and visually pleasing.

**Stretch goal user stories:**
🐿️ As a user, I want to have a “back to top” button so that I can easily return to the top without manually scrolling.
🐿️ As a user, I want smooth scrolling for internal links so that I can have a seamless and enjoyable navigation experience within the website.
🐿️ As a user, I want buttons to have a hover effect so that they appear more interactive and I can easily identify clickable elements.
🐿️ As a user, I want a basic footer with social media icons that link to social media pages so that I can easily connect with the website on social platforms.
🐿️ As a user, I want a background music track that plays automatically when the website loads so that I can have an enhanced and enjoyable browsing experience.

**Reflections:**

_🎯 What requirements did you achieve?_
I've managed to achieve all the user stories including the stretch goal ones.
_🎯Were there any requirements or goals that you were not quite able to achieve?_
I think the second user story re responsive, I may have not achieved it 100%. I noticed the overlay text that I positioned over the images does not resize when the page is resized. I tried the display flex on that designated overlay class but it seemed to completely destroy the layout so I didn't investigate that further. Otherwise all the other elements did resize without any issues.
_🎯 If so, could you please tell us what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?_
As mentioned above, the overlay text does not resize properly like the other elements on the webpage. Not sure what I did wrong there. Will need to investigate that further at some point.
_What went really well and what could have gone better?_
I think I did manage to get everything done. There were a few hiccups. e.g. I initially made a mistake of assigning the absolute vs relative the right way. I did the other way around and it didn't work. I realised that the aboslute should be positioned relative to whatever it must be positioned under. I struggled a bit tring to figure out how to get the transparency in the overlay elements and also the sticky nav bar. I researched this by inspecting Frankies' tomato timer website. I noticed the fourth number after the RGB values. I found out that that was what helped change the opacity. I had previously tried opacity but later ound out that by using opacity I was just making the text opaque but not the background which was what I wanted. One mroe thing, I started of with the basic requirements first before delving into the stretch goals. Earlier I was thinking about the stretch goals and then figuring out the main requirements which often overwhelmed me.
_Detailing useful external sources that helped you complete the assignment (e.g Youtube tutorials):_
I used Frankies Website Tomato Timer. I inspected it through the browser inspect tool. That helped quite a lot in figuring out the strucuter and styling. I also refered to MDN docs. I also refered to Chat GPT to understand why the audio won't play automatically. I understand that I will need to use JS for this to work seemlessly. Right now it does play sometimes but not always. I did use JS but through a prompt in the previous assignment but I didn't want to include such a prompt this time. I think if I don't defer the JS and then write a JS Script to get that audio element and then set it to play, it may work. I haben't tried that but since it's a stretch goal and it does work sometimes I've skipped it. I'm still lagging behind my other assignments so I think I won't spend anymore time on this.
_Describing errors or bugs you encountered while completing your assignment:_
There were quite a few. I struggled with the positioning a bit as mentioned above but I managed to get through it with thehelp of google search and inspecting Frankies tomato time website.
**References:**
(e.g Third-party APIs, CSS resets, icons, images... )
I haven't listed down the sites I got the images fron this time. All were through google search. THe icons I used for the footer were from a site from where I coulddownload all social media icons for free. The GIFs, I have linked the GIF's button on the page to the site from where I donwloaded the background gif from. The iniital banner and the photo of the cast was from one of the first google search results.
